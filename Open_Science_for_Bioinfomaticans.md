Open Science for Bioinformaticians  
(An Introductory Two-Day Virtual Workshop)

We are excited to announce a two-day virtual introductory workshop on open science, specifically designed for young professionals in Nigeria who are eager to build expertise in bioinformatics. This workshop aims to equip participants with a solid foundation in open science principles and practical skills in bioinformatics tools and platforms.

Program Overview:
Our workshop will cover key aspects of open science, including its principles, benefits, and real-world applications in bioinformatics. Participants will engage in interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and discussions to enhance their understanding and practical skills. This program is in response to the need to build a critical mass of bioinformaticians who imbibe open science principles in their work. By the end of the workshop, attendees will be well-versed in managing and sharing bioinformatics data, navigating ethical and legal considerations, and collaborating effectively using open science platforms.

Target Audience:
This workshop is ideal for young professionals who are interested in the fields of bioinformatics, Open Science, and its intersection. Advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of life sciences, computer science, and related disciplines who are interested in bioinformatics and open science and researchers and academics who are new to open science and wish to incorporate its principles into their work.

Selection Criteria:
We aim to select 25-30 motivated individuals who meet specific criteria for our two-day virtual introductory workshop on open science and bioinformatics. Applicants should have an educational background in life sciences, computer science, or a related field. This program is particularly suited for early-career professionals or advanced students, such as undergraduate seniors and postgraduates, who have a keen interest in bioinformatics and open science. Interested candidates should possess a basic understanding of bioinformatics tools and concepts, along with a willingness to learn and apply new skills. A demonstrated commitment to attending both days of the workshop and actively participating in all sessions is essential. To apply, interested individuals should submit a brief statement (200-300 words) detailing their interest in bioinformatics and open science, and explaining how they plan to apply the knowledge gained from the workshop. This statement will help us identify those who are most likely to benefit from and contribute to the workshop.

N.B: The Selected participants must be available to fill out pre and post-survey questionnaires.  

How to Apply:
Interested candidates are invited to apply by filling out the application form. Applications will be reviewed based on the selection criteria, and successful applicants will be notified at least a week before the workshop.
Join us for this transformative workshop and become a part of the next generation of bioinformatics experts who champion open science principles.
